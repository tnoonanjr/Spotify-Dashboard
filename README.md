# Dashboard
Welcome to the Spotify Dashboard, a web application that leverages the Spotify API to provide in-depth insights into your music profile. This app integrates various features to offer a comprehensive view of your Spotify experience.
<br>
## Features
**Interactive Playlists and Tracks**: 
Use JavaScript to dynamically load and display your playlists. Each playlist is rendered with up-to-date information pulled directly from the Spotify API.
Real-time Track Updates: JavaScript functions periodically update the list of your top tracks and current queue, ensuring you always see the latest data.
<br>
### Enhanced User Experience
**Responsive Layout**: JavaScript enables a responsive layout that adjusts to different screen sizes. Elements like playlists, top tracks, and artist profiles are rearranged automatically based on the device youâ€™re using.
<br>
### Interactive Elements
Buttons and links are equipped with JavaScript event listeners that enhance interaction, such as expanding details, switching between tabs, or filtering content without requiring a page reload.
<br>
### Advanced Features
**User Authentication**: The app uses Python and the Spotify API to handle authentication flows, including login and logout, allowing users to securely access their personal Spotify data.

## Development
Spotify Dashboard is powered by the Spotipy library for backend operations and Flask to render HTML and CSS. JavaScript functions play a crucial role in:

Fetching and rendering data from the Spotify API.
Enhancing the user interface with interactive elements and real-time updates.
Managing the dynamic layout and responsive design of the web app.
